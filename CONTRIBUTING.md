# Contributing to Xemu Symphony

`Xemu Symphony` is an independent, sovereign downstream fork of Xemu dedicated to bit-accurate Low-Level Emulation (LLE) of the Motorola Symphony DSP56362 Encoding Processor (EP) and discrete 5.1 multi-channel audio preservation.

We welcome clean, well-tested contributions that advance hardware accuracy, audio fidelity, and platform portability.

## Architectural Principles & Scope

Contributions touching the APU, audio pipeline, or core emulator must conform to these architectural boundaries:

1. **Pure C Engine**: The DSP56300/DSP56362 execution core is strictly implemented in ISO C (C99/C11). Do not introduce Rust toolchain dependencies, foreign function interfaces (FFI), C++ templates, or runtime JIT compilers into the DSP subsystem.
2. **Lossless Direct Tap**: Multi-channel surround is tapped directly from the internal DSP mixer aperture into discrete 6-channel 32-bit floating-point LPCM (`surround_buf`). Pull requests attempting to revert the audio pipeline to lossy AC-3 bitstream encoding, virtual S/PDIF ring buffers, or host `liba52` round-trips will be rejected.
3. **Silicon Accuracy & Memory Layout**:
   - **P-RAM Aperture**: 32,768 words ($0x8000$) backing the full 64 KB `NV_PAPU_EPPMEM` hardware window.
   - **Data Precision**: 24-bit word packing (`& 0x00FFFFFF`) across all ALU, AGU, and peripheral registers.
   - **Bit-14 DMA Hole**: Memory transactions addressing bit 14 (`addr & 0x4000`) target unmapped hardware space (reads return `0x000000`, writes are discarded).
   - **Y-ROM Isolation**: The factory Y-ROM table ($Y:\$0800$–$Y:\$0FFF$) is read-only public domain ATSC A/52 mathematical constants generated via `tools/gen_yrom.py`.
4. **Subframe Budgeting**: Execution steps must respect the 128 µs subframe budget (`EP_SUBFRAME_CYCLES 12800`). Never introduce unbounded execution loops that block the QEMU main event thread.

## Code Style & Standards

- **Language**: Strict C99/C11 for emulator core and subsystems; modern C++ (C++17) only where interacting with existing UI code (`ui/xui/`).
- **Formatting**: Run `clang-format` on all new or modified C/C++ files. Changes should match the local style of the target file without introducing unrelated whitespace churn.
- **Build System**: All code must build cleanly via Meson and Ninja orchestrated by `./build.sh` (or `build.sh -p win64-cross` under Docker). Do not commit raw Makefiles, CMake lists, or IDE-specific project files.

## Commit Message Standards

Commit messages must be concise, descriptive, and follow the structured format:

```text
<subsystem>: <short imperative summary>

[detailed technical explanation of hardware behavior, register state, or bug fix]

apu/dsp: implement multiple wrap-around agu addressing for m0 register

monitor/sdl: scale buffer drain watermarks to prevent 5.1 stream starvation

ci: update linux appimage packaging script for llvm-21 toolchain
```

## Testing & Validation
All functional PRs must document verification against real hardware expectations or retail game titles:

1. Compilation: Clean compilation under GCC or Clang without new compiler warnings.

2. Frame Pacing: Verification that title audio does not cause subframe dropouts, audio thread deadlocks, or dsound.sys timeout spinloops (locked 60 FPS performance).

3. Channel Verification: When modifying audio routing, confirm that Front Left, Front Right, Center, LFE, Surround Left, and Surround Right route cleanly to their expected discrete DirectSound speaker indices.

## Use of AI Tooling
Generative AI and automated reasoning tools are recognized as valid aids for structural scaffolding, regression auditing, and silicon analysis, subject to strict ownership:

1. Total Code Ownership: You are personally responsible for every line of code you submit. You must understand, verify, and be capable of defending the technical logic during review. Unreviewed copy-paste output or hallucinated register shims will be closed immediately.

2. Transparency: If a non-trivial patch was co-authored or audited using AI tools, state the model and methodology in the PR description or append an entry to AI_DISCLOSURE_LOG.md.

## Communication & Governance
- Technical discussions, bug reports, and PR reviews occur exclusively on GitHub (Issues, Discussions, and Pull Requests). We do not funnel review processes through external chat servers.

- Reviews prioritize technical rigor, hardware parity, and reproducible stability. If a patch works, passes CI, and adheres to our architectural boundaries, it will be merged efficiently.
